# Book Research Tool

## Overview
This project is an advanced book research tool designed to enhance the accessibility and usability of academic texts. Utilizing state-of-the-art language models and a user-friendly interface, this tool allows users to query the book for specific information, facilitating efficient research and study.

## Use Case
The primary use case of this tool is to assist data science students, researchers, and professionals in quickly locating and extracting relevant information from comprehensive texts. By inputting questions related to the book’s content, users receive accurate and contextually relevant responses, streamlining the research process.
Book used for Demo - **“Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow**

## Key Features
- **Multiple PDF Support**: Handles multiple PDFs, allowing for the integration of various academic resources.
- **Advanced NLP Integration**: Leverages OpenAI’s GPT-3 to provide precise answers to user queries based on the book’s content.
- **Document Embedding**: Uses OpenAI Embeddings and FAISS vector stores to create an efficient searchable database of the book’s content.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval techniques with generative models to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly Streamlit-based application for seamless interaction and querying.
- **Contextual Accuracy**: Ensures responses are based strictly on the provided context, enhancing the reliability of the information.

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: For managing the language model interactions and processing.
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3 for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search and retrieval of document chunks.
- **Python**: Core language for developing and integrating all components.

## Impact
This tool significantly reduces the time and effort required to sift through extensive academic texts, providing a powerful resource for anyone engaged in deep learning research or studies. By integrating multiple PDFs, it also serves as a scalable solution for broader academic research needs.

This project showcases my skills in leveraging advanced NLP technologies, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to create practical, user-centric solutions in the data science domain.
